/*
- varible and constants 
1. const - make the value to not change 
2. let - It is more prefered 
3. var - in js , scope was the issue , there is no scope. due to which is leads to problom so it is not prefered to use because of issue in block scope and functional scope. 
4. without keyword - It is not prefered as make it less readable else no problem. 

if we just declare the varible and not initalizing it thne i will contian value as undefined .

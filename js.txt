- To run the File 
1. Save the file with .js 
2. Ensure Node.js is installed 
3. Use command "node <file>.js" 

-- we can use console.table([values, comma seperated]) to show the output in console as the table 

- varible and constants 
1. const - make the value to not change 
2. let - It is more prefered 
3. var - in js , scope was the issue , there is no scope. due to which is leads to problom so it is not prefered to use because of issue in block scope and functional scope. 
4. without keyword - It is not prefered as make it less readable else no problem. 

if we just declare the varible and not initalizing it thne i will contian value as undefined . 


-- In prev verison of js there is no things like classes etc. 
-- IN order to use new version of JS we use "Use strict" that allow node to understand that we are using the new js 

-- we can't simply use alert() function in node as it will work in document file or in html 

-- we can learn from MDN , EC39 

Data types 

1. number  => 2 to power 53
2. bigint
3. string
4. boolean
5. null => it is a standalone value, in js it is treated as object
6. undefined => only declared not assigned
7. symbol -> unqiueness check

8. object****


Conversion of data type 
1. Number - using " Number(score); " also in this 
// "33" -> 33
// "33A -> NaN(Not a number)
// understand -> NaN
// null -> 0

2. boolean - using " boolean(score) " 
// "" -> false
// 1 -> true
// 0 -> false
// "mrigaank" -> true

3. string -> "String(score)"

 strict check- both check type and also the data using extra equal === , !== 


 Return type of variables in JavaScript
1) Primitive Datatypes
       Number => number

       Boolean  => boolean
       null  => object
       undefined  =>  undefined
       Symbol  =>  symbol
       BigInt  =>  bigint

2) Non-primitive Datatypes
